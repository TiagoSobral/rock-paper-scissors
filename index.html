/* 
Planing:
- the program has no interface
- the only interaction will be the user choosing rock, paper or scissors.
- the user will have to input the data, (a string into the console).
- the desired output will be to compare the input from the user versus the output from the computer and compare to see who wins.
- the game will be a best of 3 (possibly)


- the computer chooses randomly rock, paper or scissors.
- the user chooses rock paper or scissors.
- what did the computer choose?
- what did the user choose?
- rock beats scissors; scissors beats paper; paper beats rock;



Pseudocode:
- when the user inputs a string : "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors";
- the computer should randomize and output one of the same 3 choices.
- if the user chooses rock and computer scissors print (computer looses)
- if the user chooses scissors and computer chooses paper print (computer looses) 
- if the user chooses paper and computer rock print (computer looses.)
- if the user chooses the same as the computer print (its a tie! try again!)
- else print (user looses! Play again!)
